Hello! I hope this repository finds you well :)
I'm incoming second year BSIT Student, and here are some of my activities I have done since I started.
I hope this can help somehow to help you have insights or practices in JAVA

Disclaimer!
I'm not yet good at it, and I'm still learning. I'm very open for feedbacks, and help to improve my coding journey.

That's all thanks! :p
